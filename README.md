## How I learned Web development so far !
Here comes the fun part! Since I'm definitely a self-learning person, and I know there are tons of **FREE** resources on the internet, so I started to research. 

There still have pros and cons doing this way, I may spending too much time searching and reading articles or online-tutorials that is out of dates, but the process is also kind of fun and challenging. Usually I follow up these materials simultaneously and making simple projects in practice.
